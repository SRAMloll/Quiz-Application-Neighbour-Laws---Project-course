In order to successfully complete the course, your app will need to feature the following points:

It is available on GitHub and you regularly committed the changes using git.
It uses the Flask web framework.
It uses at least one module from the Python Standard Library other than the random module (for example, you could use the datetime module.)
It contains at least one class written by you that has both properties and methods (yes, plural!). It uses __init__() to let the class initialize the object's properties (note that __init__() doesn't count as a method). This includes instantiating the class and using the methods in your app. Methods that only print something in the terminal will not be considered.
It makes use of JavaScript in the front end and uses the localStorage of the web browser.
It uses modern JavaScript (for example, let and const rather than var).
It makes use of the writing to and reading from the same file feature.
It contains both conditional statements and loops.
It doesn't generate any error message even if the user enters a wrong input.
It lets the user enter a value in a text box at some point. This value should be received and processed by your back end Python code.
It is styled using CSS.
The code follows the code and style conventions we introduced in the course, is fully documented using comments and doesn't contain unused or experimental code. In particular, the code should not use print() or console.log() for any information the app user should see. Instead, all user feedback needs to be visible in the browser.
